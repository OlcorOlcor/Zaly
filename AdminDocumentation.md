# Admin Documentation
The admin interface allows you to create, delete and modify both users and questions.
# Users
On the index page of the admin interface is the list of all users.
The Add user and Edit user buttons both lead to a form where you are able to change anything except for the password.
You can also delete a user altogether with the delete button.
Last but not least are the arrows that add or subtract points from the user.
# Questions
Similarly to users, the question page allows you to create, delete and modify questions.
Each question has a name, the actual questions, an answer and an optional image.
Questions are seperated into two categories - Simple and Multichoice. You can choose which one you want with the Multichoice checkbox.
If a question is multichoice a new button appears that allows you to add choices.
